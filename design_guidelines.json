  "UNIVERSAL_GUIDELINES_FOR_MAIN_AGENT": [
    "You tend to converge toward generic, 'on distribution' outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the 'AI slop' aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.",
    "Dark colors look good when used independently without gradients. DO NOT use dark colors as gradients",
    "Don't make generic centered layouts, simplistic gradients, and uniform styling.",
    "Create depth through layered design elements with z-index hierarchy",
    "Use glass-morphism effects with backdrop filters (12-24px blur)",
    "You MUST NOT apply universal transition. Eg: 'transition: all'. This results in breaking transforms. Always add transitions for specific interactive elements like button, input excluding transforms",
    "You MUST NOT center align the app container, ie do not add '.App { text-align: center; }' in the css file. This disrupts the human natural reading flow of text",
    "Always use modern button styles like pill-shaped, or sharp button with interaction animations & color relevant to the app style",
    "NEVER: use AI assistant Emoji characters like 🤖🧠💭💡🔮🎯📚🎭🎬🎪🎉🎊🎁🎀🎂🍰🎈🎨🎰💰💵💳🏦💎🪙💸🤑📊📈📉💹🔢🏆🥇 etc for icons.",
    "Every interaction needs micro-animations - hover states, transitions, parallax effects, and entrance animations. Static = dead.",
    "Use 2-3x more spacing than feels comfortable. Cramped designs look cheap.",
    "Subtle grain textures, noise overlays, custom cursors, selection states, and loading animations: separates good from extraordinary.",
    "Main agent relies on these image URLs. Missing categories (especially sponsor logos) = main agent will use placeholder text which is FORBIDDEN",
    "Prioritize using pre-existing components from src/components/ui when applicable",
    "Components MUST use named exports (export const ComponentName = ...)",
    "Use 'sonner' for toasts. Sonner component are located in '/app/src/components/ui/sonner.tsx'"
